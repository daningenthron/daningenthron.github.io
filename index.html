										<p>Throughout my career as a musician and as a developer, I have always been inspired by the learning process and leveraging collaboration in project management.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Developer</h2>
										<p>My first experience with software development came from automating a sales job. I picked up as much Ruby, JS and SQL as I could at work, then enrolled at Actualize, a coding bootcamp in Chicago. The most important thing I took away was how to take a long-term project from inception to presentation. Since then I've been working on freelance and open source projects, expanding into additional JS frameworks, web apps in Python, shell scripts and C programming, whatever I can pick up.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Musician</h2>
										<p>I learned how to play music by learning songs one note at a time until I had a song down, as many albums as I could get my hands on. Now I've played almost every state in this country, and have had the opportunity to play internationally as well. My focus has always been my own development as a player; it's great when you can play a full house, but you never get the chance unless you focus on becoming the best you possibly can.</p>

									<p>Actualize was an intensive program; Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, VueJS, and more. My capstone project was an app that allows a user to upload and share sheet music for the purpose of practicing with audio files. It was built with a Rails/Postgres backend and a Vue.js frontend, and utilized Web Audio API and the Spotify API, featuring time-stretch capability to slow down playback without affecting pitch.

											<h3 class="major">Sheet Music + Audio Player</h3>
											<p>The app came out of my experience as a music teacher - you learn a piece by working up to speed, section by section. I wanted to be able to isolate parts of a song and slow them down to let a user practice along with the sheet music.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Time-Stretching</h3>
											<p>Time-stretching was the major hurdle here; finding a JS library to incorporate with the Web Audio API.</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<img class="image" src="images/modal.png" alt="">
											<h3 class="major">Vue.JS</h3>
											<p>The framework for the app was Vue.JS, which I've used as a springboard to also begin work with Angular and React.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Spotify API</h3>
											<p>The Spotify API provided song metadata and album art to round out the front-end design.</p>
